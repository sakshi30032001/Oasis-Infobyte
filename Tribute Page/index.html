                                <li>When eight years old, Modi was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began 
                                    attending its local shakhas. There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, 
                                    who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political
